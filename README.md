This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript's `IsEmpty()` function.  The function returns `True` not only for uninitialized variables, but also for variables that contain an empty string. This behavior can lead to unexpected results and logical errors in your code. The bug is demonstrated and a solution is provided. The solution explains that one needs to check against an empty string specifically to solve this unexpected behavior.
